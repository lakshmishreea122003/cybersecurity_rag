# cybersecurity_rag

## Introduction
I developed a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for cybersecurity using LangGraph and LangChain. This system processes raw text and images from penetration testing outputs, constructing and updating a knowledge graph through LLMs to generate accurate, context-aware responses. The final output provides plaintext responses, integrating relevant context from the knowledge graph to enhance insight into vulnerabilities and system weaknesses.
